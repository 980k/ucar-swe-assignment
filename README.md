# UCAR Software Engineering Assignment

## Description
This project is my proposed solution for the assignment provided by UCAR. The software package has been designed using the **Strategy Pattern** and **Factory Pattern**, coupled with **Dependency Injection**. This design approach ensures **flexibility**, **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **testability**. 

The package can be utilized in two ways:
1. As a **standalone program** that end-users can operate directly.
2. As a **library** that developers can seamlessly integrate into their existing code bases.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Language
- **C++**

### Build System
- **CMake**
