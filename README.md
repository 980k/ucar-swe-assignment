# UCAR Software Engineering Assignment

## Description
This project is my proposed solution for the assignment provided by UCAR. The software package has been designed using the **Strategy Pattern** and **Factory Pattern**, coupled with **Dependency Injection**. This design approach ensures **flexibility**, **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **testability**. 

One of the key benefits of this design is its extensibility. Future contributors can easily add new parameterizations, modify existing ones, or even delete parameterizations as needed. This makes the package highly adaptable to evolving requirements and use-cases.

The package can be utilized in two ways:
1. As a **standalone program** that end-users can operate directly.
2. As a **library** that developers can seamlessly integrate into their existing code bases.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Language
- **C++**

### Build System
- **CMake**
